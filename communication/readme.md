## TCP/IP

Basically Internet protocol ensures that every computer connected to the internet as an ip address which is unique across the world.
And TCP Transmission Control Protocol, this sets rules on how the data transfer between two computers happen.
First it establishes a connection with destination and the acknowledges the connection. Then
1⁠ ⁠Data is converted to packets
2⁠ ⁠⁠Each packet is numbered
3⁠ ⁠⁠Each packet contains source ip and destination ip and other details
4⁠ ⁠⁠Each packt surfs through the internet and reaches destination
5⁠ ⁠⁠And based on the numbers they are reassembled at the destination again
6 ⁠⁠And it also verifies whether the message is sent correctly to the mentioned destination aswell
7 It terminates the connection when the entire data transfer is complete
8 If a packet is lost inbetween it will resend the packet
9 It provides error checking aswell.
